## Webpack module federation and multi-frameworks

### Example 1

The [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation-tools) for the `@angular-architects/module-federation-tools` package shows an example of how to use webpack module federation in a multi-framework environment. The example can be seem live at https://red-ocean-0fe4c4610.azurestaticapps.net/dashboard.

![Module federation with multi-frameworks](static-assets/module-federation-multi-frameworks.png)

The setup includes:
- an Angular shell that loads MFEs that are in the same or different version of Angular, as well as MFEs using different frameworks such as React, Vue and AngularJS. The Angular shell contains the top navbar, as well as the content for the home and the dashboard tabs. The code for the shell is at [manfredsteyer/
multi-framework-version](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/multi-framework-version). This repo also contains an `mfe1` app which is the micro-frontend for the content of the flights tab.
- A React mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/react-app](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/react-app).
- An Angular1 mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/angular-app1](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-app1).
- An Angular2 mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/angular-app2](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-app2).
- An Angular3 mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/angular3-app](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular3-app).
- A Vue mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/vue-js](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/vue-js).
- An AngularJS mfe app with code at [manfredsteyer/angularjs-app](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angularjs-app).

There's also a [tutorial](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/mf-tools/tutorial/index.md) available for the above setup.

### Example 2

Another example of a multi-framework setup can be found at [manfredsteyer/multi-framework-micro-frontend](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/multi-framework-micro-frontend). This example contains:
- a shell in Angular 13.
- a mfe1 app in Angular 13.
- a mfe2 app in Angular 12.
- a mfe3 app in Angular 12.
- a mfe4 app in React 17.

### Common errors in Webpack Module Federation

- [inject() must be called from an injection context](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65004891/inject-must-be-called-from-an-injection-context-when-importing-angular-app-u): usually happens when multiple versions of the Angular platform are instantiated.
- [Cannot read property 'Éµmod' of undefined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66586956/getting-cannot-read-property-%C9%B5mod-of-undefined-when-importing-custom-module): usually the problem is that you're trying to access an incorrect module. For instance, on the `ModuleFederationPlugin.exposes`, a micro-frontend app exposes a module with the key `mfe1` but the shell app is trying to access the remote module from the micro-frontend app using an incorrect key, meaning, anything else other than `mfe1`.

## Custom elements aka Web components 

- :star: [Web Component-based Micro Frontends with Angular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee17YczpCpU): great video showing how to structure your micro-frontend apps. It doesn't use Webpack Module Federation but all the concepts on this video are great and applicable when you're using Webpack Module Federation. The code for the video can be found at [fboeller/microfrontends-with-angular](https://github.com/fboeller/microfrontends-with-angular).
