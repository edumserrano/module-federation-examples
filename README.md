Examples of how to setup webpack module federation.

## Example's list

1) [basic-ng16](/basic-ng16/README.md): the most bare-bones possible example of how to setup webpack module federation using two angular 16 apps. This example does NOT make use of the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) npm package which is usually used to setup module federation for angular projects. The main idea is to show the basics for learning purposes.
   
2) [angular-architects-ng16](/angular-architects-ng16/README.md): two angular 16 apps using webpack module federation. Instead of a manual setup that is shown in the [basic-ng16](/basic-ng16/README.md) example, this example used the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) npm package, which is a package that aims to streamline the module federation setup.
