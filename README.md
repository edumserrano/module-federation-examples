Examples of how to setup webpack module federation.

## Example's list

- [basic-ng16]: the most bare-bones possible example of how to setup webpack module federation using two angular 16 apps. This example does NOT make use of the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) npm package which is usually used to setup module federation for angular projects. The main idea is to show the basics for learning purposes.
