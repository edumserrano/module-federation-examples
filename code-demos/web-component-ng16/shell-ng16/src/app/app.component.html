<div id="root" class="card">
  Shell running Angular {{ version }}
  <!--
    The 'my-mfe-element' web component was created by using Angular custom elements
    to convert an Angular component into a web component. In doing so, Angular will
    create kebab cased attributes from the Angular inputs as well as properties
    with the original casing used on the Angular component.

    For this example, this means that the my-mfe-element web component has an
    attribute named 'input-text' and a property named 'inputText'.

    As such, there are several ways to pass input to the web component.

    Using the attribute:
    1) input-text="Hello from shell!"
    2) [attr.input-text]="'Hello from shell!'"
    3) [attr.input-text]="someVariableToBindTo"

    Using the property:
    1) [inputText]="'Hello from shell!'"
    2) [inputText]="someVariableToBindTo"

  <my-mfe-element
    input-text="Hello from shell!"
    (message-sent)="onMessageSent($event)"
  ></my-mfe-element>
  <p>Message received by the shell from the Web component:</p>
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
