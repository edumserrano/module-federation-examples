## Description

## TODO

The mfe1 app will set the input of the `CheckoutComponent` to `555` and subscribe to the output of the component which logs to the console when the `Checkout` button is clicked. See [app.component.html](/code-demos/advanced-ng16/checkout/src/app/app.component.html). 


This means the subscription done by the dev platform of the component's output that logs to the console when the `Send message` is clicked, is not part of the exported component.
