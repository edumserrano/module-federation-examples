## Description

Setup of Webpack Module Federation using the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) npm package instead of doing everything manually as shown in the [basic-ng16](/code-demos/basic-ng16/README.md) code demo.

The remote webpack module contains an Angular module which the shell loads using Angular routing.

The shell app is rendered in a red colored background and the remotely loaded mfe1 app is rendered in a blue colored background.

## How to run

1) Go to `/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/shell-ng16` folder and run `npm i`, followed by `npm start`. This will start the shell app on http://localhost:4200.
2) Go to `/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/mfe1-ng16` folder and run `npm i`, followed by `npm start`. This will start the mfe1 app on http://localhost:4201.

To see the mfe1 app loaded into the shell go to the shell's URL and click the `Load Angular module named MyFeatureModule from mfe1` link.

## MFE1 app

The mfe1 app is an Angular 16 app that contains an Angular feature module named [MyFeatureModule](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/mfe1-ng16/src/app/my-feature/my-feature.module.ts), which was created to represent the micro frontend that we want to expose via Webpack Module Federation.

The `MyFeatureModule` Angular module contains a route that loads the [MyComponent](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/mfe1-ng16/src/app/my-feature/my-component/my-component.component.ts) Angular component on `/my-component`. You can use the `Go to my-component` link on the mfe1 app to load the `MyComponent` Angular component.

### Exposed webpack module

On the [webpack configuration file for mfe1 app](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/mfe1-ng16/webpack.config.js) you will find the declaration of the webpack modules to expose:

```
exposes: {
  "./my-feature-module": "./src/app/my-feature/my-feature.module.ts",
},
```

The above defines a webpack module that is named `my-feature-module` and that is mapped to the [./src/app/my-feature/my-feature.module.ts](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/mfe1-ng16/src/app/my-feature/my-feature.module.ts) file, which is where the `MyFeatureModule` Angular module is defined.

### Dev platform

When you run the mfe1 app you will see the text `MFE1 dev platform`. This is to call out the fact that the mfe1 app is not exposed in its entirety via Webpack Module Federation, only the `MyFeatureModule` Angular feature module is. Everything else in the mfe1 app is there only with the sole purpose of supporting the local development of the mfe1 app, more specifically, the development of the `MyFeatureModule` Angular feature module.

## Shell app

The shell app is an Angular 16 app that loads the Angular module exposed by the mfe1 app. You can test this by selecting the `Load Angular module named MyFeatureModule from mfe1` link which navigates to the `/mfe1/my-component` route.

### How the remote is loaded into the shell

The shell app loads the Angular module exposed by the mfe1 app using Angular routing.

The `/mfe1` route added to the [AppRoutingModule](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/shell-ng16/src/app/app-routing.module.ts) uses an `import` to [lazy load](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules) the `MyFeatureModule` Angular feature module from the mfe1 app. The lazy load is done via the [loadChildren function](https://angular.io/api/router/LoadChildren) which imports the external webpack module `mfe1/my-feature-module` at runtime and then accesses the `MyFeatureModule` Angular module from the mfe1 app. At this point, the `loadChildren` function loads the routes available from the `MyFeatureModule` Angular module which means we can access the `MyComponent` Angular component from the mfe1 app by going to `/mfe1/my-component` path.

Also note that for typescript to be ok with the `import('mfe1/my-feature-module')` we must tell it that the module `mfe1/my-feature-module` exists and we do that by declaring it in the [remote-module.d.ts](/code-demos/angular-architects-ng16/shell-ng16/src/app/remote-modules.d.ts) file.

## Webpack Module Federation

The setup of Webpack Module Federation was done using the [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) npm package, which aims to streamline the setup of Webpack Module Federation for Angular apps. For more info see [Basics of @angular-architects/module-federation npm package](/docs/basics-angular-architects.md).

Also, read the official docs at:
- [the readme page for the @angular-architects/module-federation npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation?activeTab=readme)
- [the tutorial for the @angular-architects/module-federation plugin](https://github.com/angular-architects/module-federation-plugin/blob/main/libs/mf/tutorial/tutorial.md)
